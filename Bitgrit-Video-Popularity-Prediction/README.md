# Bitgrit-Video-Popularity-Prediction
Datathon conducted by MACS, DTU in collaboration with Bitgrit.<br/>
The goal of this datathon is to develop a machine learning model to predict the number of views that videos are likely to receive based on attributes such as duration, location, and time published.
<br/>
<br/>
I used Gradient Boosting Regressor Algorithm to find out the predicted views.<br/>
First of all I read the data and then clean the data by deleting, replacing and renaming some columns. 
From the training data I predicted a model which gives least error and then used that model to predict the test data and submit the predicted files in the datathon.
<br/>
<br/>
Achieved an accuracy of **90.398889%** and 5th rank in the Datathon conducted jointly by MACS, DTU and Bitgrit.<br/>
Here is my certificate of appreciation for securing 5th rank in the Datathon:
